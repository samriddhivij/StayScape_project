# StayScape_project
StayScape is a full-stack rental property listing and booking web application that allows users to explore, create, and manage property listings with ease. Built with the MERN-style stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) and EJS templating, the application follows the MVC architecture to ensure maintainability and scalability.
